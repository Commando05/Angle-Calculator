# Angle-Calculator

## Purpose

The purpose of this webproject is to act as a calculator to find coterminal, supplementary, and the quadrant of an angle.

## Format

If your angle is in degrees, put your angle in like this:
"130 degrees" or "130 degree".

if your angle is in radians, put your angle in like this: 
"2 pi / 3" or "2". ("2 pi" should also work.)

The calculator will automatically determine if an angle is in radians or degrees assuming the 
formatting is correct.

## Issues

A bug is still trying to be worked out where an input like "2 pi / 3" will only display NaN and 
undefined values. Please be aware that this conventional format for radians is not functional as of now.
